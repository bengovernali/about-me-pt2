                            <p>I was born on August 25th 1993 in Long Island. I have a younger brother and an older sister.
                                We lived in a three family apartment in Queens, NY. 
                                My mom was a High School English teacher and my dad did freelance security system installation.
                                Just before I turned 10, we moved to a small town called Somers in Northern Westchester.

                            <p>Somers was a much different place than Queens. 
                                We went from being surrounded by concrete to living with 7 acres of forest in our backyard.
                                During my middle/high school years I took up guitar, paintball, hobby modeling and joined the Boy Scouts.

                            <p>
                                Shortly after I turned 18 I left to attend Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) to study Mechanical Engineering.
                                Aside from cramming for tests and pulling all-nighters studying I managed to have a lot of fun.

                            <h3 class="sublife-heading">Post-College</h3>
                            <p>After I graduated it took me a little while to find my first job. 
                                I worked as a Test Engineer for Cyient.Inc. I was contracted to work for Pratt & Whitney, a jet engine manufacturer.
                                I assisted in engine assembly, engine test, and inspected engines pre and post run.
                                After doing this for a while I switched into a project management role in the same network.
                                After a little over a year of that, and a decent amount of consideration, I decided to leave and become a web developer.
                                These days I spend most of my free time going to concerts, playing video games, and lifting.
